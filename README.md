# 🎧 Electric Omen ML Challenge — Predicting Crowd Energy

### Machine Learning Project by Ayush Mishra (IIT Guwahati)



This project was built as part of Coding Week (ML Track) and showcases my ability to:



Analyze messy, real-world datasets

Build and evaluate machine learning models

Extract actionable insights

Deliver final predictions ready for deployment



The theme revolves around the comeback tour of the fictional band Electric Omen, where the goal is to predict Crowd Energy (0–100) using historical tour logs and the singer’s cryptic notes.



### Project Highlights

**🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**



Visualized dataset trends, distributions, and feature relationships

Identified important predictors of crowd energy

Cleaned and formatted data for modeling



**🤖 Machine Learning Workflow**



Applied supervised regression techniques

Feature engineering \& preprocessing

Model tuning for balanced generalization

Generated final predictions for all tour venues



**📊 Professional Deliverables**



analysis\_notebook.ipynb → Full end‑to‑end ML workflow

predictions.csv → Final model outputs

finding\_reports.pdf → Clean summary of insights, feature importance, model behavior
